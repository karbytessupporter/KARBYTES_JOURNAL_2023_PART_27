<p>Today I did a phone interview and filled out some onboarding documents for a local mail sorter job. I feel a lot more normal and calm than I was feeling yesterday. I ate a dried penis envy mushroom stem which seemed to help facilitate some productive dreaming while sleeping and to get rather creative with my last two journal entries. As long as I have a job which I think is decent or else am actively looking for one, I seem to be okay and able to have sufficient time and money for the things I want to get done (which is not much compared to when I was unemployed for at least one year and working on the first &#8220;sealed in&#8221; year of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">primary website</a> content).</p>
<p>I will try to spend the remainder of my life not stressing too much and appreciating life as it happens instead of anxiously waiting for conditions to match my ideals because doing so causes me to not appreciate the moments which could otherwise be grateful enjoyed. I don&#8217;t need lots of friends nor lots of money to be happy. I seem to have everything I need to thrive as a San Francisco Bay Area resident.</p>
<p>Speaking of the San Francisco Bay Area, I intend to use the BART train systems when feasible and to keep my car parked in the East Dublin BART parking garage when I am not using it (because I think it is relatively safe from being tampered with in there compared to other places I have parked it). Once I have sufficient funds I&#8217;ll purchase a commuter bicycle and try to use that in place of a car as much as it seems feasible to do so.</p>
