<p>Today I bought two over-ear headphones (Sony MDR-ZX110) for approximately $25 each from a Target store. Today I also put as much of my belongings as possible in my room (including one of the headphones I bought today) and returned the Toyota Matrix to my mom so that the vehicle is no longer my liability (and because I prefer to minimize my harmful ecological impact especially by minimizing my reliance on the fossil fuels industry). My plan now is to take a few weeks or even a few months off job searching so that I can stock up on essential gear which I use for living outside with and develop new content (especially coding modules) to add to my primary website and, perhaps later this year, look for a part time job in retail so that I can both subsidize the cost of me earning information technology credentials online and have sufficient time to advance my IT skills (so that, after I work at that retail place for a few months and get my resume as up to date as I feel is necessary in order to get an &#8220;entry level&#8221; information technology job, I can start applying and interviewing for such jobs until I get such a job). I think it would be good for my mental health to spend lots of time in the wilderness during this &#8220;hiatus&#8221; from working at hourly jobs. The wilderness I frequent has been a decent place to study because cellular phone reception is decent and because I have the requisite gear to use my laptop for up to 10 hours at a time remotely. (I have at least one working backup laptop in a storage bin in my room that works if I use a Linux bootable USB flash drive instead of the native or installed operating systems).</p>
<p>It should be noted that pig_gorl and other personalities seem to be vehemently opposed to me implementing the plans I disclosed in this journal entry. I think that such persons prefer that I not have so much free time to think, attain what I think is a decent level of physical and mental fitness, and to pursue my interests (beyond merely surviving within the confines of a socioeconimic matrix of rules which favor postponing sustainable energy infrastructure for as long as possible (even while increasing environmental toxicity which is seriously harmful to people&#8217;s health, while perpetuating violent international disputes over control of petroleum reserves, and while accelerating global climate change such that delicate ecosystems and weather patterns are severely altered and such that agriculture is detrimentally impacted), so that the fossil fuels industry can continue to monopolize the way people in my country live). I can tell that environmental issues are practically taboo to discuss with other people because what matters more is humans trying to dominate other humans by any means possible. Relying on a particular car as my primary commute means seems to be an implicit requirement for being treated as worthy of rudimentary kindness from other humans in some places. In such places, pedestrians and bicyclists are the devil.</p>
<p>Lastly, I thought it would be a good idea to state my reasons for choosing to do front-end retail instead of overnight shifts in warehouses. The latter does not afford me a quality sleep schedule because it is hard for me to get quality sleep during the day. The former, on the other hand, allows me to maintain a normal circadian rhythm. Quality sleep is a crucial aspect of optimal functioning as a human organism (especially for processing information I am trying to learn during Rapid Eye Movement sleep cycle phases). Even though I have complained in the past that I loathe customer service roles, I believe I am an expert at acting like I like people and I have an unusually high amount of energy. As long as my attitude is good, customer service is not that difficult for me. In fact, provided I have a good attitude, it is actually somewhat enjoyable (but probably only while having more important things to do outside of work which takes up most of my time; college-level studies in particular).</p>
