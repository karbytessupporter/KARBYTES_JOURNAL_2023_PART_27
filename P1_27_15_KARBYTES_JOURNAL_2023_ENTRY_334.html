<p>Today I devised the following thought experiment: imagine that I voluntarily pressed a button which caused every human being which I ever knew to instantaneously die and then, after that, all memories of such people and evidence of their existence would be deleted or else replaced with other details in the minds and data systems of the humans still alive (except for me and mine, of course (and given that only those who are part of the small group of oligarchs who rule human civilization know and I am a member of that very privileged group)). This is how I might as well start each new day (or transition from a &#8220;dead end&#8221; to a &#8220;live beginning&#8221;).</p>
<p>Today I also re-published an old <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://singularityhub.com/2020/10/15/estonia-is-a-digital-republic-what-that-means-and-why-it-may-be-everyones-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> on my Twitter and Minds pages about Estonia&#8217;s superior (to the United States of America) voting system and communications infrastructure (especially public Internet access). I think the dumb-dumb Americans need a refresher and to see how needlessly inefficient they have allowed their bureaucracies to be.</p>

<p>I think &#8220;love&#8221; is concept and word which has been grossly anthropomorphized to the extent that I am disgusted with it. <span style="background:#ffff00">My current definition of the word &#8220;love&#8221; is &#8220;the fundamental substrate in which any and all phenomena are inscribed&#8221;.</span> Hence, to say that &#8220;I love X&#8221; means that X (i.e. whatever object X represents) is included in what I perceive as and conceptualize to be the fabric of reality. To be clear, I think of &#8220;love&#8221; as being synonymous with &#8220;awareness&#8221; (especially as someone with a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/nature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">panpsychic worldview</a>).</p>

<p>I botched my attempt to communicate what that &#8220;thought experiment&#8221; piece of prose at the top of this journal entry was attempting to express. What I meant to say is that there exist some people who I think I would feel a lot happier believing were dead. In other words, there are people who I prefer to either stop behaving in ways which are either what I deem to be seriously detrimental to my goals or, if that fails, I would prefer that those people to be quickly killed off.</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">Of course I do not think any human loves any thing more than that human loves itself. I do not think that a rat loves any thing any more than that rat loves itself (and it is easy and automatic for a mother rat to invest resources in its babies&#8217; survival; not heroic (though I do think that a human generally invests more consciousness into baring and raising its offspring than does a rat because a human&#8217;s brain seems to be a more complex <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> than a rat&#8217;s brain is)).</span> <strike>I think mere molecules may be more loving (i.e. not deliberately abrasive to other sentient beings&#8217; subjective quality of experience (i.e. more allowing of other entities besides itself to exist)) than humans are.</strike> I think that the previous (striked out) sentence is fallacious. In order for one molecule named A to exist, some other molecule named B cannot exist in A&#8217;s allotment of time and space.</p>
