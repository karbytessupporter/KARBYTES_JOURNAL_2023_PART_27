<p>P: &#8220;I noticed that you have published intellectual property (on your personal websites and in your personal Internet Archive library) which you neither seem to be the original author of nor which seems to be explicitly licensed in the state you initially found them in as public domain or as open source. Hence, you could (at least potentially) be legally persecuted for <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doxing</a> or for <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pirating</a> relatively proprietary intellectual property.&#8221;</p>
<p>karbytes: &#8220;I acknowledge and understand your comments and I intend to keep publishing all content which is on my personal websites, my GitHub repositories, and my personal Internet Archive library as public domain (using my own definitions as documented in the web page of my primary website named <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/public_domain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PUBLIC_DOMAIN</a>). I justify such behavior as being analogous to photographing any phenomena which I encounter in non-private spaces and being able to legally own those photographs and to legally control access to those photographs. (I consider a region of space-time to be private if that space is being used by someone other than exclusively me as a bathroom, bedroom, indoor living quarters including tents (in general), office spaces (in general), warehouse spaces (in general), interiors of vehicles which I am not authorized to enter (in general), and hospital rooms (in general)). Hence, if I happen to be inside of one of those spaces which I deem to be private, I most likely will never take photographs of phenomena occurring inside of such spaces. <span style="background:#ffff00">I strive to keep the content which I publish online as non-intrusive and as non-detrimental to as many people as possible (but as an <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egoism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">egoist</a>, I almost always prioritize my welfare as an individual <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information processing agent</a> above that of any other individual information processing agent).</span>&#8221;</p>
