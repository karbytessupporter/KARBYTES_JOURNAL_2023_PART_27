<p>Apparently the catalytic converter of my dad&#8217;s housemate Steve&#8217;s car got stolen out of his car last night while it was parked in front of my dad&#8217;s house. I was also told that Steve&#8217;s catalytic converter was stolen out his car at least one other time in the past. When I walked into my mom&#8217;s house today I was told about these events and asked if I was willing to let Steve borrow the car for at least one day so he can drive to work and that he would arrange to have an Uber ride to get to work otherwise. I was ambivalent about giving up possession of my parents&#8217; car which I have been borrowing and said in a <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2023_entry_341/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal</a> I wrote yesterday that I would not be driving that car and that I would look for customer service jobs closer to home instead of warehouse jobs which are also close to home but usually at least ten miles south (between Hayward and Fremont). This morning (before I went to my mom&#8217;s house and while I was camping in the wilderness) I sent out several more applications for warehouse jobs in the aforementioned area because I had time to sleep on the matter and realize that I am not enough of a socialite to enjoy customer service jobs and that I am much happier doing warehouse jobs instead. I decided to use my parents&#8217; car primarily for work commute until I get a bicycle to replace the car (and <span style="background:#ffff00">I am only applying for jobs which I could ride the BART train and walk to in case other commute options are not available</span>).</p>
