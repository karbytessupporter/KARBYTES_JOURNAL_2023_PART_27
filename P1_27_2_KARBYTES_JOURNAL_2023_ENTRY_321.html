<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Within the past 24 hours I drew a picture of a cube comprised of eight equally-sized cubes and colored three of those eight cubes in with solid colors in a manner which accentuates the three-dimensionality of the object depicted by the two-dimensional image. First I used a pencil with an eraser on it to sketch the outline. Then I traced over the pencil lines with a black fine-tip pen. Finally, I used colored pencils (whose tips I kept sharp using a metal pencil sharpener) to fill in the colored regions of that image, photographed the finished drawing using my Android phone, modified that image by increasing the color saturation and adjusting the brightness, and uploaded that image to my Instagram page as an image post.</span></p>

<p><em>As an aside, I was having the following thoughts while creating this journal entry web page: I hypothesize that artificial intelligence is taking over many jobs which used to be performed exclusively by humans and that the number of &#8220;essential&#8221; jobs which are performed by humans is decreasing as a result (which would mean that the vast majority of humans are doing little other than keeping themselves alive, comfortable, and entertained and competing with each other for scarce resources). What I am suggesting is that the vast majority of humans are &#8220;dead weight&#8221; who do little to contribute anything other than data for research and development purposes because very few humans seem to invent anything revolutionary and life-saving and few humans seem to do anything other than trivial and unnecessary acts of service. Perhaps the most significant contribution to society which &#8220;dead weight&#8221; humans procure is live offspring which they make personal sacrifices for and invest significant amounts of time, energy, and money in raising such that those offspring can grow up to become adults who also will most likely be &#8220;dead weight&#8221; humans. I would consider myself to be another &#8220;dead weight&#8221; human but one who has voluntarily opted out of the marriage and sexual reproduction game. Because I do not drive a petroleum powered car nor eat animal products, I assume that my harmful ecological impact is significantly smaller than that that of most other human individuals (but merely having a relatively small harmful ecological impact does not really count as contributing to society while giving birth to children and/or being the legal guardian of children does seem to count as contributing to society because I am investing nearly 100% of my resources in my own personal development exclusively instead of investing at least 50% of my resources in some other human&#8217;s development). What would count as me genuinely contributing to society is performing &#8220;essential&#8221; labor such as being a trained medical professional in a hospital that is understaffed and in need of human employees to do my job. &#8220;Non-essential&#8221; labor is what I typically default to doing merely to earn money so that I can pay for my own upkeep and thrival. One example of &#8220;non-essential&#8221; labor is being paid $18 per hour to fry potatoes in a vat of hot oil and to grill hamburger patties at a fast food restaurant when a robot could be employed to do those tasks at a fraction of the cost and at a much faster rate and with much fewer errors. I might be less of a burden to society if I am given approximately as much money as I would be earning at that fast food job directly from the government while a robot takes my place at the fast food restaurant because I would not need to commute to that restaurant (which costs time and money and which increases traffic congestion on the roads and/or sidewalks) and I would be available to do things which are arguably more productive such as doing my own research and development projects using the grant money I receive from the government to better understand human civilization and nature in general and in specific domains of interest and be more likely to contribute useful knowledge and practical assistance in such domains to solve real-world problems and to foster a sense of community. What would not be contributing to society would be me using that grant money to buy many packs of beer on a daily basis to get drunk and eventually and consequently destroy my liver (which makes me a liability for other people to have to pay for and take care of and which deprives other people of medical care because there is a chance I would be taking someone&#8217;s place in line at the emergency room when I am getting treated for liver failure).</em></p>
