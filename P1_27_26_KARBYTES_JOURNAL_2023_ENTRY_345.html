<p><span style="background:#ffff00">A few weeks ago I was thinking about making a more elaborate simulator of what pig_gorl sounds like to me (and pig_gorl is a term I use to refer to the particular auditory harassment I frequently experience which I believe the police are targeting me with). I decided to shrink that simulator down to just two sound tracks (especially the one with the soft plaintive nag-humming which sounds like it is deliberately intended to raise my blood pressure and stress hormone levels). You can use my <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karlinaobject.wordpress.com/sound_track_loop_counter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOUND_TRACK_LOOP_COUNTER</a> application to play both tracks continuously and simultaneously to get a taste of what pig_gorl sounds like from my end. (Some people seem to think that pig_gorl is good because she does not allow me to relax nor to take my time and get immersed in what I do such that I can properly enjoy it (and people seem to prefer I be chronically stressed out so that the quality of my creative work and subjective experience suffers because such people think I deserve to be punished for some failure to conform to their standards or else those people simply take sadistic pleasure in my diminishment because it makes those people feel comparatively less disadvantaged than they would be otherwise)).</span></p>
