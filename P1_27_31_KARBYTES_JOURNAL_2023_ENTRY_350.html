<p>My suffering is illegal if and only if my suffering inconveniences other people. In other words, my suffering is only supposed to be gotten rid of if and only if it exists in other people&#8217;s perceptions enough to cause Them suffering. Some people want me to suffer now and in the future (and if that is what the Breeder Majority wants, that is what I am legally supposed to enforce: that I suffer the ways the Breeder Majority favors). The fact that I look up into the night sky and feel that I might be treated as less of a burden than down here in Earth&#8217;s biosphere especially close to where the Breeders raise their young means I might as well be treated as an imposter of an alien who parasitically consumes what belongs exclusively to the humans: air to breathe, space to reside, nutrients to sustain my body with, and attention which should be reserved exclusively for humanity sustaining itself and generating more of itself.</p>
<p>I believe that there exist some people who do not want to simply stop communicating with me. I believe that such people are not at all content to just live separate lives in which they can do whatever they want besides interfere with my life. I believe that such people are zealously in pursuit of trying to control how I think, feel, and act from a good safe distance and that such people also want to remove my content from the Internet and to make me believe that my content is being censored from the Internet and that many people want me to suffer and that many people are plotting to make me suffer in excruciating agony and that such sadistic behavior is justified by law because it is popular to hate me and what is popular is what is democratically sanctioned as God&#8217;s Will Be Done. God looks like a mob of angry dumb monkeys wielding pitchforks and torches looking for a witch to burn to death for the crime of going outside her patriarch&#8217;s home at night to practice esoteric religions instead of adhering to the script the patriarchy assigned her. AJP smiles as I burn at the stake and my journals are also cast into the fire and my beloved cat friend also burns at the stake for also practicing witchcraft and alleged bestiality with. I am to never be touched by anything but a tyrant&#8217;s possessive grip. I am never to be spoken to as anything but a subordinate and target of vitriol. I am to only be regarded as a mentally ill and evil impish demon.</p>
<p>I prayed to God that I be given omniscience. I got what I wanted: to be a human realizing also that it was a cricket simultaneously chirping next to it and that God the all encompassing attention span is aware of which debts have been paid and which have not as well as every deed ever committed regardless of whether or not the deed was recorded.</p>
