<p>I claim that I am being seriously mistreated and that my basic human rights are being violated because either an ex associate of mine (which I assume to be AJP) or an impersonator of what I just described has been harassing me nonstop since February 2019 by talking inside of my head and trying to get in between me and what I would rather be doing besides talking to that person. (For details on what I think is causing such a &#8220;telepathic&#8221; exchange, see <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry # 138 of 2022</a>). It seems that I am the only person who does not consent to this treatment. I wonder if that is because people would rather force me to culturally assimilate to their ways than allow me to focus on my own esoteric interests which those people might not be as interested in as I am. In other words, people seemingly would rather say that what I suffer from is social isolation than from feeling deprived of solitude. The latter is what troubles me far more than the former. It seems that I am the only genuine introvert I know at this time. Everyone else seems to be an extrovert. Introverts can entertain themselves for hours, days, and weeks on end if left to their own devices without feeling a twinge of loneliness. It disgusts me that more people are not that way.</p>
<p>Anyway, I almost shared a music video on my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://twitter.com/karbytes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://www.minds.com/karbytes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minds</a> pages but decided not to because I want those social media pages to emphasize either science news articles/videos or else newly published web pages from my primary website. The music video I wanted to share was some album or song by <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shpongle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shpongle</a>. I don&#8217;t know if the world is ready to truly appreciate the arts at this time.</p>
