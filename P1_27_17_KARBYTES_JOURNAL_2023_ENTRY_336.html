<p><strong>KARBYTES_JOURNAL_2023_ENTRY_336</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>As soon as I reach the limit to what I think is all possible knowledge, I have to wonder what is on the other side of that &#8220;wall&#8221;: more unknown territory. Hence, as my knowledge grows, so does how large my sense of what the unknown is.</p>

<p>I feel bad for what I wrote in the previous journal entry, but I wanted to feel bad (but only long enough to end the source of my suffering).</p>
<p>I feel bad being mean to things I care about (and as a panpsychic worldview holder, I prefer to believe that all objects have some degree of sentience because all objects are assumed to be comprised of the same fundamental substrate: consciousness).</p>
<p>Today I decided that the best thing I can do is to work between 20 and 40 hours per week while paying for myself to take online classes, purchase books, rent movies, buy gadgets, and purchase a bicycle.</p>
