<p>I&#8217;m really enjoying those ripe organic avocados which I recently bought atop slices of toasted bread. I am sitting in the garage which is currently missing its drum set because it is currently being used by my dad at some gig up north. I figured that this is a good opportunity to get some thoughts out.</p>
<p>I suspect that people have been either sending me donations or else are planning to send me donations but the police are moderating economic and informational exchanges in order to &#8220;protect&#8221; me from being persuaded by other people to give them too much of my money instead of doing what I plan to do if I happen upon such a windfall: not tell the public about how much money I have nor where the money came from nor what I do with it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Clarification: I think now is a good time to implement a new policy which mandates that I (karbytes) not disclose my income sources nor income amounts to anyone. I assume that law enforcement personnel and hackers are privy to all of my personal data (including financial data, real-time physiological state, and whatever I publish or store online irregardless of how private such data appears to be from my end of the Internet). People can share any of that data without my consent nor knowledge. What I seem to have some volition over is what I do with my own money. I want to make it clear to the general public that I do not intend to spend my money on anything other than expenses which pertain to my hobbies, special interests, and upkeep of my individual personhood. Being my friend, family member, colleague, or associate will not give you any more access to my money (which I authorize) than what you would get if your existence was unknown to me.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In other words, I do not consent to being any person&#8217;s financial provider other than myself (though I do make modest donations to recipients who provide what I think are valuable contributions to my livelihood in the form of one-time donations and monthly Patreon subscriptions).</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>As a corollary to the previous paragraph, I do not intend to help pay for my aging nor ailing family member&#8217;s expenses regardless of how much money I have. I expect to be condemned by other people for what I said in the previous sentence and perhaps even punished by them. <span style="background:#ffff00">Many people would likely say that I am a &#8220;free loader&#8221; who takes advantage of other people&#8217;s generosity without reciprocating. I justify my selfishness as an ethic which I learned from <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cats</a>. Many of the cats I have known seem to get care from humans (and freedom to go outside unsupervised and not inside of some caged in area nor on a leash) without having to do much to pay the humans back (though I think I have seen them try to help &#8220;earn their keep&#8221; by hunting for small animals and bringing their carcasses inside as a present to the humans and as proof that the cat can fend for itself if allowed to stay outside).</span></p>
